# DkRxjs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.10.
It is based on Deborah Kurata's [RxJS in Angular](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/rxjs-angular/table-of-contents) 
course on Pluralsight and Angular HTTP Client documentation - which is different from the Heroes tutorial 
https://angular.io/guide/http

Deborah Kurata's course is a great introduction to RxJS and Angular using the updated RxJS syntax that (as of the end 
of 2022) many developers have overlooked and need to move from Imperative to Declarative style.  I highly recommend it 
as well as her Ng-Conf 2020 talk on RxJS that is also available on Pluralsight.

I also updated that unfortunately ugly APM logo to something a little more modern ... still ugly, but a little less so.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you 
change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add 
a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
